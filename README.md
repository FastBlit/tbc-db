licenses should be removed from this software if you are making redistributable
copies.

Compatibility
-------------
The *TBC-DB* database is compatible with [cmangos-tbc] core only.

Getting started
---------------
The basic principle behind this database repository is to have a single SQL file
holding every table in the database. When something is changed into the database
the modification is done by adding small SQL update files placed into the `updates` directory.
Every time a user (that would be you or TBC-DB Developers) wishes to change something into the database, he/she
have to create and add the right SQL file. This helps tracking what changes are made, when and where.

Installation
------------
**TBC-DB** is the main content database for: `mangos` where the world is defined
with creatures, items, objects, quests, etc.

It must be applied after creating the `mangos` database from your CMaNGOS core distribution [cmangos-tbc] from [CMaNGOS Project].

For Easy Installation Edit The Following Windows Batch File `./Windows_Install_Script.bat` if you are a Windows User and configure
the Installation Options Setting Your MYSQL Database Names, Passwords and Source Folders.

It will provide you a Menu With Various Installation Options and Configurations That Have Greatly Simplified The Process.

For a full installation guide, please refer to [CMaNGOS installation instructions][14].

Configure InnoDB Tables & my.cnf File
-------------------------------------
Most of the database tables by default are configured as MyISAM to allow for hosting on servers with low memory limits. We can gain row-level over table-level locking in the database and improve on overall performance and reliability by converting all MyISAM tables to InnoDB, which requires higher memory usage on the server. We should also configure the my.cnf file to create larger InnoDB mempools to be used with the new tables and for other general performance optmization settings.

And if something goes wrong?

The best way to submit an issue is to use tbc-db github.
